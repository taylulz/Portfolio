        Hello! Thanks for coming to my page. I currently reside in Renton Washington and am a freelance location sound mixer in the film industry. Think of location sound as capturing the sound that is happening while something is being filmed. I show up to the location where the filming is taking place, and record the relevant sounds of what's happening on-camera. <a href="https://www.taylorjosephsound.com/">Here is a link to my film work</a>. The landing photo is from the first feature film I worked on called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect_(film)">Prospect</a>/. It features the two main characters (Sophie Thatcher and Jay Duplass) as they prepare to mine for a prescious alien mineral on a toxic moon.
      </p>
      <p>Currently I'm attending a program at Epicodus to learn how to be a developer. These two fields are very similar in many ways!</p>

      <h1>My Professional Background</h1>
      <p>I studied music composition with an emphasis in audio technology. Throughout college I supported myself by running front of house sound for Fremont Abbey Arts. This lead me to becoming the student archivist for my University. In this role I was in charge of recording, editing, mixing, and archiving <em>any</em> music related performance at the University.</p>
      <p>Dealing with recording technology, organizing massive amounts of data, and volunteering to help my professors out with their pet projects eventually lead me to a job in the tech field! My first "real" job out of college was at a company called VoiceBox Tecnhologies (which has since been sold and renamed). However, it was here that I dipped my toes into the world of technology and coding.</p>
      <p>At VoiceBox Technologies, I was part of the audio engineering team. We were responsible for capturing hundres of thousands of recordings with specific regional accents across many many different languages and in many many different environments. We would take these recordings and recreate certain environments (i.e. a car that's parked, a car that's on the freeway, a car with it's windows down, in a large kitchen, in a small kitchen, in a living room, etc.) Then we would measure for accuracy by comparing analysis between the simulated and real environments. Once we could re-create the environments within a certain percent of accuracy, we could apply this to the hundreds of thousands of recordings that we already had, saving the company lots and lots of sweet sweet cash, time, and energy.</p>
      <p>At the time I was working here, I didn't realize it, but I was actually learning a lot about technology, coding, and the soft skills of what it takes to become a programmer.</p>
      <p>However, after the one of the company's main clients floundered, they laid massive amounts of employees off (including me) eventually selling to their competitor. I was young, hurt, and skeptical to go get another job at a company after that. So I decided I would try freelance location sound recording.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Non Violent Communication</li>
        <p>Non Violent Communication is a book written by Marshall Rosenberg. Rosenberg was first and foremost a clinical psychologist. However he created this model for mediation and conflict resolution.</p>
        <li>Hot Yoga</li>
        <p>Hot yoga helps me survive the cold, isolating, dark gloom of the pnw.</p>

          <li><span id="fun">Synthesizer and midi configurations</span></li>
          <p>Here are my two main synthesizers. I have my Prologue connected to my NS5R so that anything I play on my Prologue will also trigger my NS5R. To do this with my current configurations, I have to send midi from my Prologue to my computer, route that midi to <em>return to my prologue "midi out" port</em> and then connect a midi cable from my <strong>Prologue's "midi out"</strong> port to my <strong>NS5R's "midi input"</strong> port. Imagine adding several more synths and drum machines with midi- it gets hairy fast! With these sorts of complex routing options, it's helpful to draw a picture so you don't get lost.</p>
