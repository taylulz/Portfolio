      <p>
        Hello! Thanks for coming to my page. I currently reside in Renton Washington and am a freelance location sound mixer in the film industry. Think of location sound as capturing the sound that is happening while something is being filmed. I show up to the location where the filming is taking place, and record the relevant sounds of what's happening on-camera.

        <a href="#">Here is a link to my film work</a>. 99% of my jobs comes from personal references, thus I have not updated it in a long long time! It mainly exists as a way of telling the world I am here and I exist and am doing this thing.

          <p>Here are my two main synthesizers. I have my Prologue connected to my NS5R so that anything I play on my Prologue will also trigger my NS5R. To do this with my current configurations, I have to send midi from my Prologue to my computer, route that midi to <em>return to my prologue "midi out" port</em> and then connect a midi cable from my <strong>Prologue's "midi out"</strong> port to my <strong>NS5R's "midi input"</strong> port. Imagine adding several more synths and drum machines with midi- it gets hairy fast! With these sorts of complex routing options, it's helpful to draw a picture so you don't get lost.</p>
